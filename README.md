These screenshots show that the FPGA connects to the server and sends the coordinates of the bounding box around red to the server.

### LED Driver system

As the the supply voltage is increased to the beacon, it maintains the same brightness as the led driver, and the buck SMPs are working effectively.

### Server

As you can see the server and client are in sync.
